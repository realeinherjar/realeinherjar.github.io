<p>While attending the 2023 edition of <a href="https://tabconf.com">TabConf</a>,
hosted in Atlanta, USA, from Sep 6th to Sep 9th,
I also attended <a href="https://base58.school">Base58</a>&rsquo;s
intensive course on <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/taproot/">Taproot</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature">Schnorr signatures</a>.
The course took place in the two days before the conference,
on Sep 4th and Sep 5th.</p>
<p>Here is a very broad overview based on my notes,
a bunch of readings and some of my own research.
I am omitting a lot of details here.

<h2 id="taproot-design-goals">Taproot Design Goals</h2>
<p>Taproot was activated as a soft fork in <strong>November 2021</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>design goals of Taproot</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase privacy</strong>: hide the spending conditions
and also hide the fact that you are using a multisig.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce the amount of data on-chain</strong>: you only need to commit
to the root of the tree, and not the leaves.</li>
<li><strong>Use Schnorr</strong>: Schnorr signatures are more efficient
and allow for signature aggregation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="schnorr-signatures">Schnorr Signatures</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature"><strong>Schnorr signatures</strong></a>
are a type of digital signature scheme
that provides security and efficiency advantages
over traditional ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) signatures.
They were proposed by the mathematician and cryptographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_P._Schnorr">Claus-Peter Schnorr</a>.
Schnorr signatures improve privacy, scalability, and security.
Due to the commutativity property,
Schnorr signatures can be aggregated,
allowing multiple signatures to be combined into a single signature.
This improves privacy by <strong>obscuring the number of participants
in a multi-signature transaction</strong>.
They are detailed in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0340.mediawiki">BIP 340</a>.
The nice thing about Schnorr signatures is that
the <strong>sum of private keys is equal to the private key of the sum of public keys</strong>.
This is what I call <strong>&ldquo;commutativity property&rdquo;</strong>,
and allows for <strong>signature aggregation</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s in a more formal way:</p>
<p>$$ P = p \cdot G $$</p>
<p>where $G$ is the generator point<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
and $p$ is the sum of $n$ private keys,</p>
<p>$$ p = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i $$</p>
<p>and $P$ is the sum of $n$ public keys<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<p>$$ P = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \cdot G $$</p>
<h2 id="validation-of-taproot-scripts">Validation of Taproot Scripts</h2>
<p>The validation of Taproot Scripts as detailed in
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0342.mediawiki">BIP 342</a>,
that deals with <code>OP_CHECKSIG</code> and <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code> opcodes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.
This does Schnorr signature aggregation during the Script execution.</p>
<p>A 2-of-3 multisig with Schnorr signatures spending Script with <code>OP_CHECKSIG</code>
and <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code> would be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">pubkey1 OP_CHECKSIG pubkey2 OP_CHECKSIGADD pubkey3 OP_CHECKSIGADD OP_2 OP_EQUAL
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This would reveal everyone&rsquo;s public keys on-chain,
and also the fact that it is a multisig, with all of the conditions.
Additionally, it would be expensive to spend,
due to the number of bytes required to commit to the Script on-chain.</p>
<p>There are more elegant ways to do this with Taproot Spending Rules
and Merkle Trees, which we&rsquo;ll see next.</p>
<h2 id="taproot-merkle-tree">Taproot Merkle Tree</h2>
<p>Taproot is a series of spending conditions that are defined
in a binary tree.
Instead of a bunch of conditions that are visible using a Script,
we have a binary tree with merkle roots.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">            Root
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">             |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">             |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">         /       \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        /         \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">       /           \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    Cond 1       Cond 2
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                  /  \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                 /    \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">             Cond 3   Cond 4
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The root is a hash, and is implicity commited to on-chain.
The conditions are not visible on-chain,
because you just commit the hash of the root on-chain.</p>
<p>The way you build the root is by hashing all the intermediate states<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>,
is by hashing all the leaves and branches below the root node.
This is done using a $\operatorname{hash}(l \mid\mid r)$ function,
where $l$ is the left node and $r$ is the right node<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.
The locking script will be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">script: &lt;version-byte&gt; &lt;data&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;version-byte&gt;</code> is the version byte.
This is the version number of our &ldquo;segwit script&rdquo;.</li>
<li><code>&lt;data&gt;</code> is <code>P_x</code>, the x-coordinate of the (tweaked) public key<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="taproot-spending-rules">Taproot Spending Rules</h2>
<p>Taproot spending rules are detailed in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki">BIP 341</a>.
The way Taproot works is that you have a locking script
where all the spending conditions are hidden.
This is just the hash of the root of the binary tree below.
The way you construct the script is by using a merkle tree,
and hashing all the intermediate states,
i.e. all the leaves and branches below the root node.
The hash is done by concatenating the string representation
of the two things you want to hash and applying SHA256<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">hash = SHA256(left || right)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the following example,
you would hash <code>Cond 3</code> with <code>Cond 4</code>,
then hash the result with <code>Cond 1</code>.
This is the root commitment,
i.e. the root node,
and the thing you publish on-chain.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">       Root commitment
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">       (locking script)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">             |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">             |
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">         /       \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        /         \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">       /           \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    Cond 1       Cond 2
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    (leaf)      (branch)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                  /  \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">                 /    \
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">             Cond 3   Cond 4
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">             (leaf)   (leaf)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have 3 leaves here: <code>Cond 1</code>, <code>Cond 3</code> and <code>Cond 4</code>,
and 1 branch: <code>Cond 2</code>.</p>
<p>The way the spening rules work is that you have to provide a proof-of-inclusion,
which depends on the leaf you want to spend.
So if you want to spend <code>Cond 3</code>,
you need to provide the hash of <code>Cond 4</code> and <code>Cond 1</code>.
Whereas, if you want to spend <code>Cond 1</code>,
you just need to provide the hash of <code>Cond 1</code> and the hash of the branch <code>Cond 2</code>.
Hence, spending conditions that are higher in the tree are cheaper to spend,
because you need to commit less data on-chain.
That is why we structure the tree as most probable to be used on top.</p>
<h2 id="musig2">MuSig2</h2>
<p><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1261">MuSig2</a>,
detailed in <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0327.mediawiki">BIP 327</a>,
is similar to <code>OP_CHECKSIGADD</code>.
It allows for signature aggregation in the locking script,
and also in the unlocking script.
Hence, you can have any multisig with Schnorr signatures,
without revealing anything related to the number of participants on-chain,
multisig conditions, etc.
However,
you now need to put all the possible combinations of the pubkeys in the Script.
Mind you that this is not a problem,
because the resulting aggregate signature
will not reveal the underlying individual signatures.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a MuSig2 example 2-of-3 threshold,
you&rsquo;ll need 3 spending conditions:</p>
<p>$$P_1 + P_2$$
$$P_1 + P_3$$
$$P_2 + P_3$$</p>
<p>where $P_n$ is the public key of the $n$-th participant.</p>
<p>Generally, for $n$ pubkeys with a threshold of $t$,
you need a list of size $\binom{n}{t}$ for all possible combinations.</p>
<p>Continuing the example,
for every two pairs of pubkeys,
aggregate them using elliptic curve cryptography modular algebra,
tweak them (if necessary)<sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>,
and create a script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">(P_1 + P_2) OP_CHECKSIG
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, you consruct your Taproot tree listing all the possible spending conditions.
(Remember to prioritize by the most plausible spending conditions on top).
Calculate the root commitment by hashing all the intermediate states,
which are the spending conditions on each leaf or branch,
from bottom to top.
Pick an internal key
and if necessary, tweak<sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> it to derive an external key.
Finally, lock up some bitcoin to the root commitment.
That&rsquo;s it!
You have a Taproot tree with MuSig2 that is compact on-chain,
and also private.
Additionally, you can add more creative spending conditions using Script
to the leaves of the tree.</p>
<p>To spend it, in your unlocking script,
you&rsquo;ll need to provide a proof-of-inclusion
of the spending condition you want to spend,
and the aggregated signature to unlock that spending condition.</p>
