# Hello World

This is the first blog entry in the blog.

I am building this blog using [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) in Rust.
This is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/realeinherjar/realeinherjar.github.io).
Feel free to check the code.

The RSS feed is generated using the [`rss` crate](https://github.com/rust-syndication/rss).

Technically speaking, Rust and Dioxus are straightforward to use.
However, [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a bit of a pain to use.
Documentation sucks and the API is not very intuitive.
I welcome any PRs to improve it.
Honestly, I prefer to hammer my fingers than to have to deal with CSS.

For the Rustacean out there,
this personal site and blog is ready for you to fork and use.
You can add API endpoints with [`axum`](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) and [`sqlx`](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx),
and consume them with [`reqwest`](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest).
