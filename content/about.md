I identify as a post-modern cypherpunk,
prioritizing the importance of **privacy** and **individual freedoms**.

**Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world**.
Privacy is not just a personal preference
but a **fundamental right that is essential for protecting individual freedom,
democracy, and the integrity of the digital world**.

**Individual liberties are the inherent and inalienable right of every person
to exercise autonomy** over their **personal information** and **choices**,
safeguarding them from **unwarranted intrusion**, **surveillance**,
or **interference** by external entities.

In this scope, I focus on the digital and online part of our lives.
My mission is to **empower individuals in reclaiming control over their technology**,
and **exercise their privacy and individual liberties to the fullest**.
To achieve this, I advocate for **technological sovereignty**,
where you own both the software and hardware you use.
If you're interested in taking control of your digital life,
be sure to check out my [guide on achieving greater privacy](../privacy/).

In my daily work,
I'm predominantly immersed in the world of Rust,
and I'm a passionate supporter and user of Nix.
Additionally,
I actively contribute to the Bitcoin Rust ecosystem by developing and enhancing libraries.
