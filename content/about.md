This is a nym.
I'm a recovering academic in my mid-30s.
I hold a PhD and was a faculty member in a computer science department for 5 years.
My background is in computational statistics and machine learning.
I've supervised a couple of PhD students,
and taught undergraduate and graduate courses in machine learning,
deep learning, statistics, data science, and programming.

I am fluent in Rust, Python, and C/C++.
Due to my data science background, I also know R, SQL, and Julia.
I am comfortable in navigating almost any codebase,
disrespecting the programming language,
and also in learning new languages and frameworks.
I am avid Nix user and advocate.
My workflow, both personal and professional,
is heavily based on Git and GitHub:
PRs, issues, code reviews, CI/CD, project management, releases, etc.
I have solid experience with Docker, Linux and Nix environments, and cloud computing.
As a computational scientist, I am familiar with cryptography,
and I have advanced math skills.

During the day,
I work full-time as a senior scientific software engineer at a software company.
In my free time, I follow the technical developments of Bitcoin,
and also contribute to the ecosystem.
I have a deep understanding of the Bitcoin protocol,
lightning network, and the ecosystem in general.
I also have a good understanding of the economics and game theory behind Bitcoin.
Furthermore, I have knowledge about the codebases of open-source Bitcoin projects,
mainly in Rust and C/C++.
