This is my personal site at [realeinherjar.github.io](https://realeinherjar.github.io).

It is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
and the theme is [WonderMod](https://github.com/Wonderfall/hugo-WonderMod) by [Wonderfall](https://github.com/Wonderfall).
WonderMod is a fork of an original theme called [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).
Since PaperMod isn't interested in a few changes such as **removing inline JavaScript**,
which I personally require to harden my websites,
I am using the WonderMod fork.
The search functionality needs JavaScript to be enabled.
However, it doesn't break the user experience if JavaScript is disabled.

The site is currently hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Deployment is done through a [GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/realeinherjar/realeinherjar.github.io/tree/main/.github/workflows).
